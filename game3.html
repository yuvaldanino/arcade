<!-- 
This was my open source game which i got from githib and linked on the website 
and here : https://github.com/Ade-mir/snake-game-js/tree/main
The snake game code didnt actually work so i had to fix it. 
I had to change some of the movment methods as the snake was able to move backwards. 
I also had to change the css to make it work with my files.
I also had issues with the game screen they provided not working so i had to implement 
that.
It took me around 1.5 hrs to fix the game but now i am really happy with it and 
how it looks.
