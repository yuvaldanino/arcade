 # Yuvals Arcade 

- ## Arcade with 4 games

- tic tac toe
  -   easy to make
  -   changed the style and made more visually appealing 
- roll a die
  -   created functions which chooses image based off the random number we roll
  -   was a cool function to learn
- snake (open source) (https://github.com/Ade-mir/snake-game-js/tree/main)
  -   one of my favotite games growing up
  -   was harder to make than i anticipated
  -   had to fix issue where snake can go backwards
  -   had to add feature where snake cant go through the walls
  -   had to add styling to ensure the snake grid worked and there was no overlapp
  -   Struggled more with this open source code than i should have as it had bugs i needed to fix, I really liked the style of the game so it was worth a struggle.
- wordle (open source) (https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wordle-clone/tree/main)
  -   my favorite and hardest game to make
  -   the open source code was not working at all only the styling of it worked
  -   main problem was that the code would always choose the same word for you to guess.
  -   i had to add functions which would intialize a game and choose a new word each time
  -   i had to add a button which allows the user to play multiple times and chooses a new word each time
  -   i had to fix a lot of the style elements which were overlapping a lot and covering the game screen
  -   this game took the longest as it had a lot of actual bugs in the code. im happy i struggled with it as i learned a lot and at the end i got it to work.
